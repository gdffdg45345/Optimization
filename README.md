The study aims to improve serve performance and prevent injuries among young tennis players through advanced three-dimensional biomechanical modeling and optimization algorithms.

##  Abstract

In the field of sports biomechanics, optimizing the rotational serve technique of young tennis players has become a crucial research focus for improving performance and preventing injury. This study presents a comprehensive three-dimensional biomechanical analysis and optimization strategy for the rotational serve technique.

Using advanced motion capture systems and musculoskeletal modeling, key kinematic and kinetic parameters of the lower limbs, trunk, and upper limbs were extracted across different serve phases. Neural network-based modeling, inverse dynamics, and energy transfer analysis were applied to identify critical joint torque generation patterns and segmental coordination strategies.

A multi-objective genetic algorithm framework was proposed to optimize serve parameters, aiming to maximize ball speed while minimizing joint loading. Experimental validation with young competitive athletes demonstrated significant improvements in serve velocity, technical consistency, and biomechanical efficiency after applying the optimized interventions.

This research provides scientific guidance for tennis coaches and young athletes to achieve technical refinement and injury prevention through data-driven biomechanical optimization.
